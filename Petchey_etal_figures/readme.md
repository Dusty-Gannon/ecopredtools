This folder contains R code and data to make some of the figures in the manuscript [*The Ecological Forecast Horizon,
and examples of its uses and determinants by Petchey et al*.](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/01/11/013441).

Figure numbers below relate to the version of the paper published in Ecology Letters, and not those published on bioRxiv.

Code and data for figures 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 is available. Note that code for figure 4 does not include the model used to create the plotted data. Figures 1 and 7 were made in Keynote, so there is no code. Code and data for figure 6 is currently unavailable.
