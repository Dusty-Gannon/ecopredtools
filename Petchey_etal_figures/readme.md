This folder contains R code and data to make some of the figures in the manuscript [*The Ecological Forecast Horizon,
and examples of its uses and determinants by Petchey et al*.](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/01/11/013441).

Code and data for figures 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 is available.

Figures 1 and 9 were made in Keynote, so there is no code.

Code and data for figures 6 and 7 is currently unavailable.
